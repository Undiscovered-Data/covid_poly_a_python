# covid_poly_a_python
Use python to analyze the poly-a tails of the Covid-19 virus
Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/ And download Nucleotide Records.
This code will separate incomplete viruses from complete ones, then get the length of the complete viruses' poly_a tails and graph it.
Requires Python3 and Matplotlib.
You can run the code from the one_command folder which is simple for the user, just put the downloaded file there and run all_in.py.
You can run it from the separate_commands folder, which has simpler code, but you have to run sort_by_N.py, too_short.py, no_partial.py, poly_a_tail.com, and i_plot.py. In that order.
They do the same thing. Undiscovered Data channel on youtube explains the code. It's an educational channel.
